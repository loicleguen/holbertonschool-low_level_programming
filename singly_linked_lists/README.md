# 🏷️ C - Singly linked lists

---

## 📝 Description

This project focuses on implementing and manipulating **singly linked lists** in the **C programming language**. It is part of foundational data structure training and provides hands-on practice with pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and basic algorithmic logic.

Key features include:

- Definition of a custom `list_t` struct
- Adding nodes at the beginning and end of the list
- Printing all elements of the list
- Freeing dynamically allocated memory
- Handling strings using `strdup` and `strlen`
